Android take home question
===

We're looking to see how you would write code in our real application. Feel free to use the internets however you like, this includes using any libraries you like.
What we are looking for is someone who writes code with good separation of concerns and high test coverage. Despite this application being small we want to see how
you would write scalable code as if this was a large project. The expectation is not that you complete all the requirements, but the requirements you do complete should be done with high quality. Please don't spend more then a few hours on the project.
 
Requirements:
- Please use the provided skeleton project to create your application
- App should have 2 tabs, using bottom navigation
- Tab 1 will be a list of cat breeds obtained from https://docs.thecatapi.com/api-reference/breeds/breeds-list
- Tab 2 will be a list of categories obtained from https://docs.thecatapi.com/api-reference/categories/categories-list
- When clicking on an item in the list, launch a new screen that is populated with cat pics from that breed/category using https://docs.thecatapi.com/api-reference/images/images-search by passing in the breed or category selected.
- When clicking on an item in the list of images, show a full screen version of the image.
- We don't mind if the UI isn't very pretty, so feel free to make these look pretty basic
